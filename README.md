# Danube_Thoughts

## Description
This song(DanubeThoughts) captures all the moments when you are alone. This song aims to help you relax and enter your thoughts deeply using simple lofi beats. It introduces a catchy beat in the beginning to grab your attention and tries its best to help get into the flow state with piano chords. Throughout the song, we also have a drum and bass background to help retain your attention. 

## Brainstorm


## Sonic PI
Inspired by Lofi girl (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk&ab_channel=LofiGirl), I wanted to create a song that would help myself and others study or relax. Throughout the song, we have a drum and bass background beat that features drum kicks, drum bass, high toms, and bass. This background beat gives the song rhythm (credits to Professor Harmon).  

In the initial part of the song, I wanted to introduce an iconic beat that I will use throughout the song(eternal). These catchy set of chords is inspired from https://github.com/Ronovo/Turing-Test-Media/blob/master/Singles/Ronovo%20Ronove/Lo%20Fi%20Beats/End%20of%20Life%20(Untitled%201)/end%20of%20life%20live%20start.rb. After, I wanted to make the song feel like a journey throughout the day. This song begins with when you wakeup all the way to when you sleep. All of the lofi chords in this song are inspired by https://blog.landr.com/lofi-chord-progressions/ since I have no knowledge on music fundamentals. After the iconic beat, it beginnings with a slow and steady chord (beginning) to help us wake up. The beginning is then followed by a stage waking up (daydream) where we keep the same pace and feel of the chords. After, the chords beginning to sound a little different (sunrise) where we begin to gain some energy for the day. Once we have gained the energy for the day, we are ready to tackle the world where the sound and pace of the chord begins to change (long journey). 

During our long journey, we need to take a break, so we shift our attention back to the things that give us joy (catchy beat, eternal). After our break, we want to regain the concentration we lost during our break. To do this, we pick up where we left off and continue our journey (inverted long journey, inverted sunrise, inverted daydream, inverted beginning). Once we have finished our big task for the day, we reward ourself (eternal), move away from the task and do other things that give us joy in life. However, working on the task most of the day drained our mental fatigue, so we are operating with limited energy and attention. This is where the song switches between normal chord and inverted chord progressions to represent our tiredness and limited mental energy. At the end of the day, we beginning to wind down (ending) and go to sleep so we are rejuvented for the next day (eternal). Throughout the entire song, I use the same BPM (45) to give us the same pace and feel to help us reflect on our daily lives. By making the song uniform, it helps us recall memory, so we can reflect on our days easier. 

I wanted this song to model our daily human behavior and attention as much as it can. 

## Music Video
This music video features a relaxing boat ride along the Danube River. I took this video when I was in Hungary and I remember it was one of the most mesmerizing and relaxing experiences ever. I thought the video would pair nicely with this song because the scenary is super calming and beautiful. The river helps make our thoughts fluid and creates a tranquil environment. I wanted to add a vintage feel to the song to represent reflecting on the past and enjoying your current and past memories.
